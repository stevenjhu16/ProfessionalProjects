Instructions on how to operate the Constantine Course Management System:

General(*Very important):
* Assume that Admin is the first one login into the system
* Data will not be serialized until the user logout(logout as soon as you create courses or users to save your work!)
* The default admin username is Admin, and the password is Admin001
* When prompt to choose a functionality, enter ONLY number that correspond to the specific functionality
-- When prompt to answer Y/N question, please answer only the letter(case-insensitive)
-- "NOT ME" keyword is reserved for login functionality, cannot be used as password
-- Username and password are case-sensitive
-- Unless otherwise specified, when prompt to enter a course, only enter the course name (case-sensitive)
-- Unless otherwise specified, all inputs are case-sensitive
-- The program assumes that there are no more than 10 sections per class


Admin:
-- Admin can only add a student with a created account(does not necessarily need login credentials) to a course

Student:
-- Student can only initialize username and password and cannot change them later on
